# Contributor's Guide

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How you can help

As with any open source project, there are several ways you can help:

* Submit [bug reports](#reporting-bugs) and feature requests into the issue tracker
* Submit [patches](#patches) to reported issues (both those you find, or that others have filed)
* Help with the documentation

## Reporting bugs

Please provide detailed information about your environment and steps to reproduce the problem.
Specifically, please include the following:

* Output of `mvn --version` command:
    * Operating system
    * Maven version
    * Java version
* Whether you are running Maven inside an IDE, and in that case, which IDE
* Plugin configuration
* Any relevant information from the log files

## Patches

Patches and pull requests are very welcome as long as they adhere to the following simple rules:

* the existing coding style is preserved;
* the patch does not needlessly introduce major code refactorings;
* the patch preserves backwards compatibility;
* no existing integration tests are broken by the patch;
* code and site documentation is updated, all new goals and parameters are marked with `@since <version>` tag;
* javadocs are kept compliant with doclint;
* ideally, integration tests are provided to cover the changes introduced in the patch.
